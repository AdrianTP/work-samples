Tanda Code Challenges
=================================

Welcome to the Tanda Code Challenges! If you've been sent this link, it's because we are keen to see your programming or design skills in action. (If you've stumbled across this repo, we're also keen to see your skills in action - feel free to have a go at the challenges!)

Chances are you already know which challenge is right for you, but if not, a quick summary:

- **browse rosters**: a challenge for designers and front end web developers. Challenges include redesigning an existing feature to be easier to use.

Each challenge will have more information about how to complete the challenge, and how to submit them when you're done. If you get stuck at 
any stage, please ask! If you've been chatting to someone from Tanda, email them back, otherwise just send an email to developers@tanda.co 
and we'll be happy to help you out.

By the way, if you find any bugs or things you think could be improved in these challenges, please submit a pull request :)

## Why does this exist?

Most companies ask you to email them a resume. We think resumes are dumb. Rather than telling us what you can do, we think it's best to show us what you can do! These challenges are an easy way to do that.
