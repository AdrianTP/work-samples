Tanda Code Challenges
=================================

Welcome to the Tanda Code Challenges! If you've been sent this link, it's because we are keen to see your programming skills in action. (If you've stumbled across this repo, we're also keen to see your programming skills in action - feel free to have a go at the challenges!)

Chances are you already know which challenge is right for you, but if not, a quick summary:

- **modeling**: a challenge for business analysts. Challenges include system design, process mapping, and working with APIs.
- **punctuality**: a challenge for front end web developers/engineers. Challenges include building modular functionality, AJAX, and working with designs.
- **pings**: a challenge for back end developers/engineers. Challenges include building a simple and stable server, data storage, and responding to HTTP requests.
- **widget**: a challenge for designers and front end web developers. Challenges include designing a new dashboard widget based on existing data in Tanda.

Each challenge will have more information about how to complete the challenge, and how to submit them when you're done. If you get stuck at any stage, please ask!
