Quality Assurance
=================================

This task is a challenge for quality assurance analysts, or anyone with a relevant technical background that would be interested in taking on a quality assurance role.  

Being a SaaS platform, updates to Tanda are distributed to our clients on a daily basis.  In fact, it is common for many updates to go out every day!  These updates range from the addition or improvement of obvious customer facing features, to more subtle changes such as bug fixes and more technical improvements that allow for better future development.  As such, quality assurance is an important part of the development process, and assuring these changes have the desired impact is *crucial* to the overall success of the product.  

Your challenge is to investigate our roster validation feature and to design a testing plan.  

This challenge should take no more than two hours to complete.
